## 📖 What This Project Does

> - What the program does:
>   
> The program simulates a hospital scan department that manages patient queues for MRI, CT, Ultrasound, PET and X-Ray scans throughout a typical working day. It models how patients arrive with different urgency levels and how these requests are scheduled and processed using a prioritisation system. 
> - The problem it addresses:
>   
> The program addresses the challenge of efficiently ordering patients based on urgency while minimizing waiting times. By incorporating queue management logic and tracking wait times, the system provides insights into how scan resources are utilized over time. 
> - Who would use it:
>   
> The program can be used by hospital administrators and healthcare planners to optimise scheduling decisions, improve patient flow and enhance overall operational efficiency in real healthcare settings.

## 📊 Visualisations

> Below are the 3 charts the project produces:
>
> 1. **Chart 1** —  Bar chart showing queue by scan type
> 2. **Chart 2** — Line chart showing wait times across day
> 3. **Chart 3** — Pie chart showing urgency breakdown

## 🧱 Classes & Functions

> Briefly list the classes and standalone functions in your project:
>
> **Classes:**
> - `Patient` — stores patient details and urgency levels
> - `Scan` — represents individual scan requests
> - `Scheduler` — class manages the queue and prioritises patients using a sorting mechanism based on urgency levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
>
> **Standalone Functions:**
> - `load_patients()` — loads scan request data from a CSV file using Pandas
> - `prioritise_queue()` — sorts patients based on urgency
> - `calculate_wait_time()` — computes patient wait times throughout the day
